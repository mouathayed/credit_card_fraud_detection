# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
Explore a robust machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent transactions using a detailed dataset from Kaggle. This project utilizes over 550,000 anonymized credit card transactions from European cardholders, featuring rich attributes designed to help pinpoint fraudulent activities effectively.

## Dataset and Features
- **[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023)**: Explore the dataset used for training our models. Key features include:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
  - `V1-V28`: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
  - `Amount`: The transaction amount.
  - `Class`: Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Objectives
- Analyze multiple classification algorithms to find the most effective for fraud detection.
- Focus on enhancing true fraud detection and reducing false positives.

## Contribution
We encourage the community to contribute to evolving the detection methods as fraud tactics become more sophisticated. Your insights and improvements are invaluable to making financial transactions safer for everyone.
